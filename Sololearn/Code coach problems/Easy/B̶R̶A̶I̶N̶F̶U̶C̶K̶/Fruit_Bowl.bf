+>>>,[-[->+>]<<]<[>>]>>[-[-[->+>]]<<]>[<<]>>.





						Explanation:
### Idea:
You just need to divide given number by 2
and then divide it by 3

We can use any cell size

So there is no problem with input and output

### Important information:

You can visit my brain-fuck-library repository

Open Basics folder and see divide function to understand how it works






### Program:

###### First two lines is just divide by 2 from divide function(basics folder):

+>>>,


[-[->+>]<<]<[>>]>>


Then you can see modified divide by 2 function (divide by 3)

It is all just previous function but with one line changed

[

	-

	[
	
		-
		
		[->+>] 		#This line changed
		
	]

	<<

]

And then we will move to the result slot

If a%3==0 we will be near the result slot(p is a pointer):

0 res

p

and if a%3!=0 we will be 3 slots away from res:


0 0 0 res

p



So first we anyways want to move left:

>

Then if we was near the result we have to move 2 times left

[<<]


and then it don't matter where we are

we just go right 2 times

>>

and print the result

.
